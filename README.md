# Drink Trackr

A drink tracking app designed to help you monitor and manage your beverage consumption effortlessly.

## Description

This project was made in Android Studio using Flutter. This project compiles into an app that runs on Android and lets users create an account or log in to an existing account. Account authorization is taken care of by using Firebase Auth. The app itself uses TensorFlow Light AI and machine learning to determine what type of drink you have, making logging easy and intuitive. It uses Flutter plugins for tables and calendars to show your drink history and progress.
